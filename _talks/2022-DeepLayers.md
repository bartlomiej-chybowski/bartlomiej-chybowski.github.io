Epilepsy is a common condition that affects the brain and causes frequent bursts of electrical activity. Many epilepsy cases are treatable with medicines, but not all of them. Those cases require surgical intervention. 

To help clinicians to decide, which part of a brain to resected, we harness machine learning techniques to predict seizure onset zones.
