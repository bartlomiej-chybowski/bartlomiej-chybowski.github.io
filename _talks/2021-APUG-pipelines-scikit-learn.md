I gave a talk about building pipelines using scikit-learn library. 

---

The purpose of using pipelines is to automate the execution of certain steps, one after another in an easy way.
One can imagine it as a recipe for preparing fruit, any kind of fruit, to eat. First of all, the fruit has to be checked if it is fresh, then it has to be cleaned, then peeled, then cut and finally served. A pipeline is a magic box that does it automatically without the unnecessary hassle... and there is no magic trick in this!
