I gave a talk about unit testing in python.

---

Writing big and complex applications is an iterative process. One starts from one function and then adds new ones and modifies old ones. However, the problem starts when there are bugs and something is not working. How to localise the problem, and how to make sure everything is working every time one adds a new bit of code? This is exactly the purpose of unit testing: to test logic in the code and save time.
