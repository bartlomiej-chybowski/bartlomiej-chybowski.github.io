Highlights:
  - Short segment of iEEG can achieve similar results in localization of the epileptogenic zone as a model based on long recordings.
  - Random selection of short iEEG segments may give rise to inaccurate results.
  - It is important that the analyzed segment is carefully and systematically selected, preferably from NREM sleep.
